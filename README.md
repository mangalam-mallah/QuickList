A dedicated grocery list app built with React Native (Expo) and Firebase to simplify item tracking and management.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of building this app came from a common problem: whenever we had to buy groceries, we often struggled with maintaining the list—whether it was written on paper or shared in messages. Items were missed, lists got lost, and it was hard to track everything.

This app solves that problem by providing a **centralized, easy-to-use platform** to:

- Add items
- Delete items once bought
- Maintain a clear **history** of items month-wise

It’s designed to make grocery shopping hassle-free and organized!
